### Howdy 👋

My name is Kelsey and I work at GitHub as a sr. content strategist doing content thingies. I'm Colorado-based, Montana-bred, and fueled by strong coffee 🤪, singletrack 🚵‍♀️, and snowflakes ⛷️. 


⚡ Fun fact: I've never eaten a :hotdog: (hold your questions plz) but I've eaten most other things 🍴
